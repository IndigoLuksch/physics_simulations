# Electrostatic potential field constructor 

## Goal
Given a desired V field, the model constructs a charge distribution that would generate this V field


## Method
- Generate lots of C (charge distribution), V (V field) data -- C is generated randomly and then the corresponding V is calculated
- Train model
