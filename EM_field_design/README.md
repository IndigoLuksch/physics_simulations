# EM field design

## Goal
Given a desired electric and magnetic field, the model constructs a charge and magnetic dipole distribution which generates this field. 

Further, I aim to create model that can output a physically constructable structure. 

## Method
- Generate lots of C (charge distribution), V (V field) data -- C is generated randomly and then the corresponding V is calculated
- Train model
